With three years of experience as a Cloud Engineer, I have a proven track record of building scalable, resilient systems while
fostering a passion for continuous learning and innovation. I am particularly skilled in infrastructure and security, ensuring
robust and secure solutions. What motivates me most is working collaboratively with diverse teams to tackle complex chal-
lenges and deliver high-quality results that make a meaningful impact.
