I am a Cloud Engineer with three years of experience in designing and building scalable, resilient systems. My key focus areas include infrastructure and security, where I’m passionate about enhancing system robustness and safeguarding data integrity. While committed to learning continuously, I also recognize that I have been susceptible to external validation, and I am actively working on building self-reliance and personal growth.

🌱 Currently diving deeper into infrastructure as code, automation, and cloud-native solutions.
